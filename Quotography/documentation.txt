//Node modules is not being uploaded in Repository.To run project install node modules by running this cmd 
in terminal and run project.  npm install


Middleware: A code or a function that runs on a server before getting request or sending response.

for example: The code we used in app1.js
app.get('/create',(req,res)=>{
    res.render('create',{title:'Create Quote'});
})
these are the examples of middleware.The order of function is more imp bcoz server reads the file from top to bottom.
That's why we are writing the 404 function at last.
//Manually using middleware by below code
//Implementing MiddleWare
app.use((req,res,next)=>{
 console.log('new request made');
 console.log('host: ', req.hostname);
 console.log('path: ', req.path);
 console.log('method: ',req.method);
 next();
});
app.use((req,res)=>{
    console.log("in the next middleware");
 });

Instead of writing middleware codes at line by line we can use thirty party middleware by installing it.
=>To install, Type npm install morgan

STATIC FILES

Like html,we cannot reference the stylesheet in a head section if we do so, the styles are not applied
to the page Becoz each and every file is being protected by the browser without giving access to the
user to modify it.To do so, We have to make it "public" using the inbuilt function and then create 
public folder then add stylesheet or external files to the folder.
